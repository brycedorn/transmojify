Looking to find someone to help parse strings that have emojis in them and categorize words to the emoji they relate to into a machine-understandable data structure. While this does not require knowledge of code, it does have some syntax specifics (described below).

There are two ways to categorize emoji:
  - "word": ["emoji"]
    - An emoji (or multiple in a row) signifies a word (String: Array[String])
    - There can be multiple emoji entries for a word
  - "word": "synonym"
    - A word is signifies another word, e.g. "daddy's": "daddy" (String: String)
    - These are generally for verb conjugations (e.g. "running": "run") to prevent duplicates


For example, the string: "im 👼 daddy’s ❤💦🍆 little fidget spinner💫 when daddy 💞 feels horny he lifts 🚚"

Would translate to this data structure:

{
  "daddy": ["👼", "❤💦🍆"],
  "daddy's": "daddy",
  "horny": ["💞"],
  "lift": ["🚚"],
  "lifts": "lift",
  "spin": ["💫"],
  "spinner": "spin",
}
